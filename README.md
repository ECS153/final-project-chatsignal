# final-project-chatsignal

To run the project locally, go into ./final-project-chatsignal/chat-signal and run the command 
`npm run build` to make a new production build.
After the build is complete, a "build" folder will appear. Move that folder to ./final-project-chatsignal/chat-signal/public and replace the old build.
Go into the public directory and use the command
`npm start` to start the project locally. The default port is localhost:3000.
