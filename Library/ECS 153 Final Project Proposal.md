#Chat Signal: Proposal
###Che-An Wu, Corbin Harrell, David Guo, Jason Lin, Nathan Ng

For our final project, we decided to approach the problem of encrypting the content of messages in a chat messaging application. We wanted to do this specific problem because we believe privacy is important. Mobile carriers, the government, and skilled hackers will have relatively easy access to SMS text messages simply because they aren’t encrypted end to end. 

Many companies that own messaging apps claim that their users’ privacy is protected, however, it is not really possible to actually know if the messages are all encrypted properly since most of the messaging application is close sourced. When people are messaging others on what they believe is a secure site, sensitive information is bound to be said. Such content could include personal information like phone numbers and credit card numbers. The possibilities are endless, and the potential risks of your chat content leaking and letting others know who you’re chatting with can be extremely dangerous.

Our main goal is to build an open source web based chat messaging application that has end to end encryption on the text messages. Each user will have an unique account and can have a list of contacts. The user will also have full control over how long the messages are visible to the receiver.  If we have extra time, we plan to also implement sending encrypted images and allowing people to message in chat groups.

With the final product, we expect to create a secure chatting platform that puts privacy as its top priority and will allow users to chat freely, knowing everything they say will not be accessible to anyone else.
